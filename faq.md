Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

**1. What is Blazor?**

Blazor lets you build interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript. Blazor apps are composed of reusable web UI components implemented using C#, HTML, and CSS. Blazor can run your client-side C# code directly in the browser, using WebAssembly. Because it's real .NET running on WebAssembly, you can re-use code and libraries from server-side parts of your application.

**2. Are there really no javascript?**

No, SubWeb has got not a single line of javascript! All the client side logic, like generating Navigation items, Markdown conversion, etc. are all written in pure C# and as a Single Page Application. However, behind the scenes Blazor uses javascript to achieve some of its functionalities like Url routing. But this happens oblivious to developer. Also, it is important to note that Blazor provides javascript interop if one needs to write javacsript along with C#
